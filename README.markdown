## Description ##

Bucket is a game in which the player has to collect falling drops of water in a,
you guessed it, a bucket! For every drop of water collected, the player scores
some points. If player fails to collect x amount of drops before a y amount hits
the floor, then player loses.

There are other objects falling down that may affect the player score if caught.

In a machine using a sudden motion sensor (a laptop, presumably) the player can
control the direction in which the bucket is moving by tilting their laptop. In
other machines, the player should still be able to use the arrow keys.
